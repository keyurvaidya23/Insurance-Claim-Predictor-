Insurance Claim Predictor Model
This project develops a logistic regression model to predict insurance claims based on health plan prior authorization data. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various features related to insurance claims and their approval rates. The model pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as scaling and encoding, followed by logistic regression for classification.

Setup and Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. It's recommended to use Python 3.8 or above. You can download it from python.org.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd your-project-directory
Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit application:
arduino

streamlit run app.py
Optionally, you can expose your local development server to the Internet using LocalTunnel:

npx localtunnel --port 8501
Usage
Once the Streamlit app is running, navigate to http://localhost:8501 in your web browser. Follow the user interface prompts to input the relevant features and get predictions on the approval rate of insurance claims.
